# Development Principles

## Core Development Values

### 1. Frontend First
- Implement and test all game logic in the frontend
- Optimize for browser performance
- Keep backend dependencies minimal
- Use browser capabilities to their fullest

### 2. Test-Driven Development
- Write tests before implementation
- Focus on game rule correctness
- Test multiplayer scenarios
- Ensure state consistency

### 3. Progressive Enhancement
- Start with single-player functionality
- Add multiplayer capabilities incrementally
- Layer AI capabilities on solid game mechanics
- Build consensus mechanism after core game works

## Code Organization

### Frontend Structure
- Separate game engine from UI components
- Isolate state management logic
- Keep card data handling modular
- Clear separation of multiplayer logic

### Backend Structure
- Simple CRUD controllers
- Clean authentication flow
- Minimal middleware
- Focus on data persistence

## Development Workflow

### 1. Feature Implementation
1. Write feature tests first
2. Implement core logic
3. Add UI components
4. Integrate with state management
5. Add multiplayer support if needed
6. Backend persistence last

### 2. Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for game rules
- Integration tests for game flow
- UI component tests
- Multiplayer simulation tests
- Performance benchmarks

### 3. Code Review Focus
- Browser performance impact
- Memory management
- State consistency
- Test coverage
- Peer-to-peer handling

## Technical Guidelines
