# Deck Management Implementation Summary

This document provides an overview of the deck management functionality implemented for the MTG Commander game.

## Overview

The deck management system allows users to:
- Import decks via plaintext in the format `<Quantity Card Name>` or `<Quantity Card Name (set)>`
- View and manage multiple decks
- Set a commander for each deck
- Add and remove cards from decks
- View card information fetched from the Scryfall API

## Implementation Details

### Backend Components

1. **Domain Models**
   - Extended the existing `Deck` and `CardDefinition` models

2. **Repository Pattern**
   - Created `IDeckRepository` interface in Core layer
   - Implemented `InMemoryDeckRepository` for in-memory storage

3. **Services**
   - Created `IDeckService` interface for business logic
   - Implemented `DeckService` with deck import parsing logic
   - Created `IScryfallService` interface for card data retrieval
   - Implemented `ScryfallService` with rate limiting and caching

4. **API Endpoints**
   - Created `DecksController` with endpoints for:
     - Listing, creating, updating, and deleting decks
     - Importing decks from plaintext
     - Setting commanders
     - Adding and removing cards

### Frontend Components

1. **State Management**
   - Created Redux slice for deck management
   - Implemented async thunks for API communication

2. **Components**
   - `DeckList`: Displays all user decks with options to view, edit, and delete
   - `DeckDetail`: Shows deck details, commander, and card list with grouping
   - `DeckImport`: Provides text area for plaintext import with progress indication
   - `CardSearch`: Allows searching and adding cards to decks
   - `CardDisplay`: Renders card information with image or text fallback

3. **Routing**
   - Implemented routes for deck list, detail, and import views

## Technical Considerations

1. **Scryfall API Integration**
   - Implemented rate limiting to avoid bombarding the API
   - Added caching mechanism to reduce API calls
   - Handled error cases gracefully

2. **Carbon Design System**
   - Used Carbon components throughout the UI for a consistent look and feel
   - Implemented responsive layouts for different screen sizes

3. **Testing**
   - Created unit tests for Redux reducers and selectors
   - Implemented component tests for UI functionality
   - Added integration tests for key user flows

## Future Enhancements

1. **User Authentication**
   - Replace hardcoded user with proper authentication system
   - Add user-specific deck persistence

2. **Persistent Storage**
   - Replace in-memory repository with database storage
   - Implement data migration strategy

3. **Advanced Deck Management**
   - Add deck statistics and analysis
   - Implement deck sharing functionality
   - Add deck versioning and history

## Getting Started

1. Extract the provided zip file, maintaining the folder structure
2. Copy the files to your project, overwriting existing files if necessary
3. Install any missing dependencies
4. Start the application and navigate to the deck management section

## Conclusion

The implemented deck management system provides a solid foundation for the MTG Commander game. It follows best practices with clean architecture, repository pattern, and proper separation of concerns. The UI is built with Carbon Design System components for a professional look and feel, and the Scryfall API integration is implemented with rate limiting and caching to ensure good performance.
