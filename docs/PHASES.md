- Interactive tutorials

### 2.4 Local Game State
- Complete local state management
- Game action history
- Undo/redo capability
- Game state persistence

## Phase 3: Deck Management & Authentication
**Goal**: Add deck management and user authentication

### 3.1 Backend Foundation
- Basic REST API setup
- User authentication system
- Database setup
- Simple CRUD endpoints

### 3.2 Deck Management
- Deck builder interface
- Deck import/export

- Deck persistence

### 3.3 User Features
- User registration/login
- Profile management
- Deck saving/loading
- Game history

## Phase 4: AI Opponent
**Goal**: Implement AI using the existing game engine

### 4.1 Basic AI Framework

- Chat system
- Player status indicators
- Connection quality management

### 5.4 Game Session Management
- Game creation/joining
- Player matching
- Session persistence
- Reconnection handling

## Phase 6: Polish & Enhancement
**Goal**: Refine the experience and add additional features

### 6.1 Performance Optimization

- Accessibility improvements

### 6.3 Additional Features
- Tournament support
- Achievement system
- Statistics tracking
- Social features

## Development Principles Across All Phases

### Component Design
- All components must support both single and multiplayer modes
- Use dependency injection for network/state management
- Clear separation between game logic and UI
- Mockable interfaces for all external dependencies

### Testing Strategy
- Each phase requires comprehensive tests before proceeding
- Test both single and multiplayer scenarios
- Performance benchmarking at each phase
- User feedback integration

### State Management
- Consistent state update patterns
- Clear action/event system
- Predictable state flow
- Easy debugging capabilities

### Documentation
- Update architecture docs per phase
- Document design decisions
- Maintain API documentation
- Track technical debt

### Phase Transitions
- Complete feature testing before phase transition
- Gather user feedback
- Performance assessment
- Technical debt review
